    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. Before you do, think about what you expect the output to be, and make sure your intuition matches up with what you run. If it doesn't, take some time to think about what happened so you can hone your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test code by running it; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "#### Function Definitions: Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have just worked with functions that return the same output every time. What if we want a function to act in different ways depending on some input? As we've hinted at, functions can be defined so that their behavior changes depending on what values are **passed** to them. You can pass any data structure(s) to a function, so long as it expects the right number of them. Values that are passed to a function are called **arguments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a function \"expect\" arguments to be passed to it? In the parentheses of a function definition, we put the names of the variables that we expect a user of our function to pass to it. We call these special variables **parameters**. This is where functions get their flexibility. When you define a function with a certain number of parameters, you can then refer to those parameters within the body of the function. Since those parameters are set when a user passes arguments to the function, they are actually controlling what happens inside the function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how we can make a function flexible by changing the `get_evens()` function that we defined above. Instead of creating a list of evens from 0 to 10 every time, let's have `get_evens()` build an arbitrarily sized list of evens, from 0 to a number the user passes in. Using our current `get_evens()` as a base, we'll begin by adding in a parameter to the function definition. This parameter will control the size of the evens list that our function builds. "

How exactly does this work, though? We've told Python that our function should expect one and only one argument. When we call the function and pass in that argument, it will get assigned to whatever name we have given in the function definition - `n` in this case. Then, anytime we reference that parameter, `n`, within the function, it will be the value that was passed to the function. Let's check out a couple of different calls to this function and see what they return."

This is useful if we want to build our function to have some default behavior, but still allow users to pass in arguments that change the default behavior or build off of it somehow. How do we specify a default parameter value for a function? It's actually pretty simple. In the function definition itself, we just place an equals sign (`=`)  after the parameter name, and then the default value that we want to specify (**Note**: Python formatting convention dictates that there should be no spaces surrounding equals signs used in this way)."

Meanwhile, when we pass in other values, we get the same results as we saw when no default value was set.

    "Okay, so those are the basics! We can also define our functions with multiple parameters, and then pass in multiple arguments for those parameters when calling the function. Similar to specifying a default value for a single parameter, we can specify default values for multiple parameters. Let's first modify our function so that we by default return a list of evens from the user inputted range, defined by `n`, but also give the user the option to input a different divisor (instead of 2 for the evens) that will then return numbers in the inputted range that are divisible by the inputted divisor (i.e. the multiples of that number). We'll also change our function name and the name of the returned list (`evens`) so that they become more descriptive (our function is no longer outputting just evens).  "
